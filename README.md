# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Each day presents a new programming puzzle, and this repository aims to provide solutions for each part of the daily challenges. They are all contained in the AdventOfCode class and are accessed through a single static function.

## Usage

To solve a specific day's challenge, use the `Solve` method from the `AdventOfCode` class. For example, to solve part 1 of day 1 using `input.txt`:

```python
AdventOfCode.Solve(1, 1, "input.txt")
```
